A brief install log from my installation of WordPress on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.

1)Make sure you have the latest version of apache2, php5, libapache2-mod-php5, mysql-server and php5-mysql. You can install all of these through apt-get.

2)Download wordpress using wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz. mv the file into /var/www. untar it. rm the wordpress folder and the tar file.

3) start mysql by issuing mysql -uroot -ppassword. use the password you set while installing mysql

4)create database wordpress;

5)in your browser, point to the address the apache server is running at. configure the install with database name set to wordpress, user name set to root, password set to your password, host set to localhost, and table prefix set to wp_

5)using nano create a wp-config.php file using the code copied from the screen.

6)time for performance tweaking. MyISAM works better on my install than the default InonDB storage engine. To change this, edit the mysql config file located in /etc/mysql/my.cnf and under basic settings add the line default_storage_engine=MyISAM

7)php caching improves page loading speeds. install php-apc using sudo apt-get install php-apc. it will automatically enable caching.

8)use a CDN and/or wordpress caching plugin to further improve loading speed
